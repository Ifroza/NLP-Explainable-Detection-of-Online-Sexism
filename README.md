# Explainable Detection of Online Sexism using NLP 
## Introduction
In online platforms hate speech, bullying, remarks of sexism is quite common. But how common? To determine this, this task has been divided into two classification tasks- binary classification which finds out whether the comment was sexist or not, and the multi-class classification which returns the what category the sexist comment belongs to. By analyzing various features, the performance of the models used have been then evaluated.
